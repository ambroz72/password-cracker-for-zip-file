The error "comparison method not supported" typically arises when the extractall() method in zipfile.ZipFile expects a password parameter that is a byte-like object (usually from str.encode()),
but the comparison or usage of the password object is not compatible or expected in that context.

Changes Made:
Explicit Encoding: Ensure the password is explicitly encoded using password.encode('utf-8'). This assumes the passwords in worldlist.txt are in UTF-8 encoding.
Adjust the encoding method (utf-8, latin-1, etc.) according to the encoding of your password list.

Exception Handling: Added specific exception handling (except RuntimeError as e:) to catch errors related to extractall().
This can help handle specific exceptions that might arise during the extraction process.

Error Output: Print the password that failed (print(colored("[-] Failed with password: {}".format(password), 'red'))) along with the exception (print(e)) to aid in debugging and understanding why a particular password failed.

Notes:
Make sure worldlist.txt contains passwords in the correct format and encoding expected by your ZIP file.
Ensure that ufo.zip is indeed encrypted with one of the passwords from worldlist.txt.
Handle exceptions gracefully and log them for troubleshooting purposes.
By applying these adjustments, the code should handle the encoding of passwords correctly and provide more informative error messages if extraction fails due to incorrect password comparison or other issues. 
This approach helps in debugging and identifying the root cause of the "comparison method not supported" error.
