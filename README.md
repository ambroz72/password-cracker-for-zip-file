# üîê Python Script to Crack Zip Passwords

I recently worked on a Python script using libraries like termcolor, tqdm, and zipfile to crack passwords for a ZIP file. Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

# Libraries Used:
termcolor: For colored terminal output, making it easier to distinguish between different messages.
tqdm: Provides a progress bar to track the password cracking process.
zipfile: Allows manipulation of ZIP archive files in Python.

# Setup:
The script initializes variables and imports necessary libraries.

#Password List:
It reads potential passwords from a file named worldlist.txt and stores them in a list called worldlist.

# Zip File:
It opens a ZIP file named secret.zip using zipfile.ZipFile.

# Password Cracking:
Using a for loop and tqdm for progress tracking, it iterates through each password in worldlist.
Tries to extract the contents of secret.zip using each password (i.encode() converts the password string to bytes).
If successful (no exception raised), it stores the password in the variable var, prints a success message in blue using termcolor, and breaks out of the loop.
If unsuccessful (exception raised), it prints a message indicating which password it's currently checking in green using termcolor and continues to the next password.

# Conclusion:

Once the correct password is found, it prints a success message and stops further attempts.
This script showcases how Python can be used for password cracking tasks efficiently and illustrates the use of popular libraries for terminal output and progress tracking.

# Possible errors...
 
The error "comparison method not supported" typically arises when the extractall() method in zipfile.ZipFile expects a password parameter that is a byte-like object (usually from str.encode()),
but the comparison or usage of the password object is not compatible or expected in that context.

# Changes Made:
Explicit Encoding: Ensure the password is explicitly encoded using password.encode('utf-8'). This assumes the passwords in worldlist.txt are in UTF-8 encoding.
Adjust the encoding method (utf-8, latin-1, etc.) according to the encoding of your password list.

Exception Handling: Added specific exception handling (except RuntimeError as e:) to catch errors related to extractall().
This can help handle specific exceptions that might arise during the extraction process.

# Error Output: 
Print the password that failed (print(colored("[-] Failed with password: {}".format(password), 'red'))) along with the exception (print(e)) to aid in debugging and understanding why a particular password failed.

# Notes:
Make sure worldlist.txt contains passwords in the correct format and encoding expected by your ZIP file.
Ensure that ufo.zip is indeed encrypted with one of the passwords from worldlist.txt.
Handle exceptions gracefully and log them for troubleshooting purposes.
By applying these adjustments, the code should handle the encoding of passwords correctly and provide more informative error messages if extraction fails due to incorrect password comparison or other issues. 
This approach helps in debugging and identifying the root cause of the "comparison method not supported" error.
